# 📚 ML Research Companion  

> A curated personal learning log of **Machine Learning research papers** - from core foundations to advanced systems.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**ML Research Companion** is my ongoing journey through the world of ML research.  
I’m documenting and summarizing papers in a way that’s:  
- **Concise** – Clear takeaways, no fluff.  
- **Technical** – Core math, key algorithms, and system insights.  
- **Practical** – Links to frameworks, implementations, and use cases.  

This repo follows a progression:  
1. **Foundations** – Optimization, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.  
2. **Frameworks** – TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, interoperability.  
3. **Systems** – Deployment, efficiency, edge AI, distributed training, scalability.
