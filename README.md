# ml-research-companion
ML Research Companion is my curated log of research papers in Machine Learning. It progresses from core foundations (optimization, CNNs, transformers) to practical frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX) and advanced ML systems (deployment, edge AI, scalability), with concise notes, key ideas, and insights.
